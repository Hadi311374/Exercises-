    Type Annotations:
        Code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to
        I've worked with different types of examples like number, string and ...
    Type Inference
        If declaration and initialization are the same line.
        Typescript will figure out the type of 'color' for us
    Type any
        A type, just as 'string' or 'boolean' are
        Mean TS has no idea what this is-can't check for correct property references
        Avoid variables with 'any' at consts
