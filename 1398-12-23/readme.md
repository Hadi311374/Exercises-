    Type annotations for functions:
        Code we add to tell Typescript what type of arguments a function will receive and 
        what type of values it will return
    Type Inference for functions:
        Typescript  tries to figure out what type of value a function will return
    Destructuring objects in Typescript
    Typed Arrays
        Arrays where each element is some consistent type of value
    Why do we care to Type Arrays
        TS can do type inference when extracting values from an the array
        TS can prevent us from adding incompatible valuse to the array
        We can get help with map, forEach, reduce functions
        Flexible-arrays can still contain multiple different types
